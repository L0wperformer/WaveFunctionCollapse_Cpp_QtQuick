# WaveFunctionCollapse_Qt_Qml
Welcome to my implementation of the WFC-algorithm in the Qt Framwork.    
An explanation (and cooler implementations) of the algorithm can be found on following sources:  
  
[Superpositions, Sudoku, the Wave Function Collapse algorithm.](https://youtu.be/2SuvO4Gi7uY) by Martin Donald  
[Coding Challenge 171: Wave Function Collapse](https://youtu.be/rI_y2GAlQFM) by @[CodingTrain](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Wave-Function-Collapse)  

I thought this is a fun algorithm to implement.  
There's still some work to do and I have some ideas in mind that I will implement at some point.

In main.cpp, there are some cool example weightlists I found while experimenting

A weightlist that strongly favours diagonals:

A weightlist that discourages Tiles that connect diagonals to horizontals, resulting in clusters:

When all Tiles are equally as likely the Canvas looks like this:
