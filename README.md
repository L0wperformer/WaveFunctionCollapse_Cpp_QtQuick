# WaveFunctionCollapse_Qt_Qml
Welcome to my implementation of the WFC-algorithm in the Qt Framwork.    
An explanation (and cooler implementations) of the algorithm can be found on following sources:

I thought this is a fun algorithm to implement.  
There's still some work to do and I have some ideas in mind that I will implement at some point.

In this example a weightlist is active that discourages Tiles that connect diagonals to horizontals, resulting in clusters:

Here, all times are equally as likely. Also the colors get switched.
